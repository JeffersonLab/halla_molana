Cleanup of unclassified/marked-pending runs. The overwhelming majority were post-commissioning target checks, general testing, 
Cu target installation tests, and some rediness testing for PREXII. These were marked junk or tests.

Additional runs were marked as testing between the close of PREXII and CREX. No paper logs exist for these and presumably 
these were taken while Simona was performing maintenance, confirming previous settings still worked and general CREX rediness preparation.
